    "When I was 10 years old pitching for the Pukalani Braves in Little League Baseball, I wanted so badly to be able to throw a curveball. I was able to throw an accurate fastball, but I wished to expand my pitching arsenal. My tiny little hands could barely cover half of the baseball, but I didn't let that discourage my pitching dreams. Unfortunately, even Google couldn't provide me with any answers after looking up, \"How to throw a curveball for kids.\" I tried and tried but to no avail. My small body just didn't have what it took to throw a curveball, or any breaking pitch for that matter. 10 years later, I've decided to accomplish my childhood goals in another way: through computer code. \n"

    "I've created a simulation that can throw fastballs, curveballs, and sliders at any user-input speed. First, I had to define all constants including the mass and radius of ball, gravity, density of air, cross-sectional area, initial spin and velocities in all 3 axes, throwing angle, and $k_d$ and $k_l$. $k_d$ and $k_l$ are the drag and lift coefficients that I use in all 3 ($x$,$y$ and $z$ directions) of the acceleration equations. When the cell below runs, it'll ask the user to choose a pitch by typing \"FB\", \"CB\", or \"SL\". FB is a fastball, CB is a curveball, and SL is a slider. Depending on what the user selects, the code assigns different values for spin, direction, and throwing angle. For example, the fastball is thrown downwards at an angle of $1.2 º$ with backspin of $200$ $\\frac {rad}{s}$. The slider is thrown with a side spin of $-250$ $\\frac {rad}{s}$. To account for the side spin, I've included an initial velocity in the opposite direction. Furthermore, this cell asks the user for an input of initial velocity. Typically, fastballs are thrown between 94-99 mph, sliders are thrown between 82-90 mph, and curveballs range from 75-85 mph.\n",

However, if you've ever wanted to see what a fastball with unrealistically insane backspin or a slider that moves more than 4 feet side to side, you can change the values for the different omegas to see how it affects the graphs. Furthermore, I recommend inputting unrealistic velocities just to explore and see how the path of travel is affected.*"

    "There were a couple things I didn't account for in this simulation. One thing is that the coordinates of the ball when it's being released is not (0,0,6) like I said it was. There is usually almost a $y$-component when the ball is being released. There are two reasons why I didn't incorporate this into my final project. First and foremost, I completely forgot about the $y$-position. I forgot that the pitcher doesn't release the ball directly inline with home plate. Secondly, by the time I realized I had left this out, I thought that it wouldn't add too much to the simulation since the simulations purpose is to show the movement of the ball with spin. In a way, starting the ball at a position of $y=0$ is a better way to show the movement of the slider (which has side spin). Another thing to note is that a lot of assumptions were taken when writing this code. I took a rough average of better than average pitchers in the MLB and set that equal to the spin of my three different pitches. I also assumed the throwing angle of the different pitches, which again, was a rough estimate based on videos and simulation runs. \n",
